# Turing-Machine
During my Java class, I had - with a team - to implement a boardgame named Turing Machine.

## Description
The game is based on the famous Turing's machine, and the goal is to guess a code, with the help of some criterions that one and only one code can satisfy.
*For exemple, there is a code 322 and one of the criteria could be "the second number is odd".*

## Langages
We used Java, and for GUI I used Swing.
